Solution 
3-Phase supply from overhead lines is secured via a 3-pole MCB and 
fed to a phase-protection relay. The relay instantly trips on detecting
the phase angle/fault anomalies, outputting a 5 V fault signal. The LoRa 
module transmits fault data wirelessly to the control station. The receiver Arduino 
triggers a buzzer and display update, showing device ID and fault type for rapid faultÂ isolation.
